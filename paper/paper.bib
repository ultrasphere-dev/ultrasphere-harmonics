From these series representations we derive Fourier expansions in certain rotationally-invariant coordinate systems and Gegenbauer polynomial expansions in Vilenkin's polyspherical coordinates. We compare both of these expansions to generate addition theorems for the azimuthal Fourier coefficients.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. {NumPy} is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, {NumPy} was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. {NumPy} is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own {NumPy}-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, {NumPy} increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface ({API}), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

We emphasize that every aspect of {PyTorch} is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of {PyTorch} on several common benchmarks.},

The proposed hyperspherical harmonic representation ({HyperSPHARM}) has many advantages over the widely used spherical harmonic ({SPHARM}) parameterization technique. {SPHARM} requires flattening 3D surfaces to 3D sphere which can be time consuming for large surface meshes, and can't represent multiple disconnected objects with single parameterization. On the other hand, {HyperSPHARM} treats 3D object, via simple stereographic projection, as a surface of 4D hypersphere with extremely large radius, hence avoiding the computationally demanding flattening process. {HyperSPHARM} is shown to achieve a better reconstruction with only 5 basis compared to {SPHARM} that requires more than 441.},

  abstract = {Shape matching remains a challenging problem. Most search engines on the internet use textual description to match images. More sophisticated systems use shape descriptors that are automatically constructed from the original 3D shape. In this paper, we propose a novel shape descriptor based on four dimensional (4D) hyperspherical harmonics. Shape descriptor using 3D spherical harmonics present the benefits of being insensitive to noise, orientation, scale, and translation. However, the radii cuts introduce a disadvantage of failing to recognize inner rotations. We address this problem by mapping 3D objects onto the 4D unit hypersphere and applying 4D hyperspherical harmonic decomposition to get the shape descriptor. The 4D hyperspherical harmonics have the same advantages of the 3D spherical harmonics and remove the disadvantage of the 3D spherical harmonics that is associated with the inner radii cuts.},

  abstract = {Expressing head-related transfer functions ({HRTFs}) in the spherical harmonic ({SH}) domain has been thoroughly studied as a method of obtaining continuity over space. However, {HRTFs} are functions not only of direction but also of frequency. This paper presents an extension of the {SH}-based method, utilizing hyperspherical harmonics ({HSHs}) to obtain an {HRTF} representation that is continuous over both space and frequency. The application of the {HSH} approximation results in a relatively small set of coefficients which can be decoded into {HRTF} values at any direction and frequency. The paper discusses results obtained by applying the method to magnitude spectra extracted from exemplary {HRTF} measurements. The {HRTF} representations based on {SHs} and {HSHs} exhibit similar reproduction accuracy, with the latter one featuring continuity over both space and frequency and requiring much lower number of coefficients. The developed {HSH}-based continuous functional model can serve multiple purposes, such as interpolation, compression or parametrization for machine-learning applications.},
